# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game typically played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbols: one player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The objective is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, which can be achieved horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Game Setup:
1. **Grid**: A 3x3 grid is drawn.
2. **Players**: Two players, one using "X" and the other "O".

## Rules:
1. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.
2. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
3. If all nine cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw.

## Winning Conditions:
- **Horizontal Win**: Three identical symbols in a horizontal row.
- **Vertical Win**: Three identical symbols in a vertical column.
- **Diagonal Win**: Three identical symbols along either diagonal.

Tic Tac Toe is often used to teach basic concepts of game strategy and logic. It's simple yet can be played strategically, especially when both players are experienced.
